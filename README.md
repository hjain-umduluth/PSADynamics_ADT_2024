Evaluating PSA Dynamics as a Biomarker for Forecasting Androgen Deprivation Failure in Prostate Cancer: A Patient-Specific Modeling Approach

Videos named 'CNP_UM100*i*(*j*).avi', *i* =  1, 3, 29, 35, 55, 99 (patient number) and *j* = 1,...,4 (row number in orthogonal design Table 2) show how successive post-nadir PSA measurements refine the predicted failure times by reducing the uncertainty in the selection of a patient’s virtual clones, even as adding pre-nadir data points have little impact on model predictions. These movies correspond to Section 3.8 in the manuscript.  

Videos named 'DNP_UM100*i*(*j*).avi', *i* =  1, 3, 29, 35, 55, 99 (patient number) and *j* = 1,...,8 (row number in orthogonal design Table 1) show how successive post-nadir PSA measurements refine the predicted failure times by reducing the uncertainty in the selection of a patient’s virtual clones, and how ADT failure probability can be predicted for future planned clinical visits. These movies correspond to Section 3.9 in the manuscript.
